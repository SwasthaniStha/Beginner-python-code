#Arithmetic operators
#those who help in  the mathematical calculations
#nothing special in here
a=1
b=2
sum=a+b
difference=a-b
division=a/b
division_without_the_decimal_points_included=a//b
multiplication=a*b
power=a**b
remainder=a%b
print (sum)
print(difference)
print(division)
print(division_without_the_decimal_points_included)
print(multiplication)
print(remainder)
print(power)
#operator precedence--> Like BODMAS rule but the higher priority is different in
#python like multiplication is more precedent than division which means
#multiplication is performed before division.in cases like 2*3/34 if not
#differenciated by braces and not made it clear the output comes as 6/34.
