#about find method
morning_route="Woke up, danced with nobi, now coding in python"
print(morning_route.find('W')) #again forgot to use the print thinking find
print(morning_route.find("nobi")) #method would do the trick but it doesnt its just a method afterall
print(morning_route.find(' ')) #space also counts as a character and also is include in the indexing. the indexing starts with 0 fyi
